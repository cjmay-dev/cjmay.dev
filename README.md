Welcome to my homelab! This site serves as a showcase of my homelab as well as my documentation for disaster recovery. I had quite a bit set up already when I decided to open source everything, so this site will initially be a work in progress as I bring everything up to date.

My goals for my homelab:

* security
* automation
* documentation
* stability

You'll notice privacy is not one of my goals. By making a showcase for my homelab and open sourcing most of the code, I'm inherently revealing some information about what I run, and I'm okay with that. I also rely on some cloud providers for "outside my network" stuff like git hosting, VPN, backups, and TLS proxies. Being fully self-contained is not a goal of mine either.

With that intro out of the way, let's check out my homelab!
